Biography
======
I am a postgraduate from Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, supervised by Prof. Su-Zhen Dong. My research interest is Fetal MRI. Especially the quantitative assessment of cardiovascular anomalies and brain development in fetuses with congenital heart disease by prenatal MRI.

A few selected studies
======

My research interests include topics in fetal MRI assessment. Most recently, I am interested in:

Three-dimensional analysis of the fetal cardiovascular and four-dimensional flow visualization using prenatal MRI with motion-corrected slice-volume registration

Three-dimensional analysis of the fetal brain anatomy using prenatal MRI with motion-corrected slice-volume registration

In addition to fetuses, I have interested in MRI assessments of brain development in children. Currently, I am equipped with a series of methods of Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and Surface-based Morphometry (SBM): I am able to perform images post-processing and statistical tests with structural MRI data using SPM12, CAT12, FSL, FreeSurfer, and MATLAB. And research indicators consist of grey matter volume, white matter volume, cortical thickness, and complexity (including Fractal dimension, Local Gyrification index, and Sulcus depth).

Research Experience
======

Evaluating hemodynamics and cardiac function in fetuses with congenital heart disease by multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (National Natural Science Foundation of China, 81971582)
------

My work: 

There were 390 cases in the retrospective case-control study, including 260 cases of normal controls fetuses and 130 complete vascular ring (CVR) fetuses. The diameters of the aortic arch isthmus (AoI) and ductus arteriosus (DA) were measured. The mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, maximum, median, and 25th and 75th percentile for AoI and DA diameter were calculated. And the differences of AoI and DA diameter were compared between the normal controls and various subtypes of CVR fetuses. Congenital heart defect (CHD) and extracardiac malformation and tracheoesophageal compression symptom were recorded.

This study reached the following conclusions: There were varying degrees of alterations in the diameter of AoI and DA in CVR fetuses which can be detected and measured by MRI in the transverse view of AA. CVR can occur in isolation or association with intracardiac and extracardiac malformation, especially VSD rather than complex heart disease. And it is very likely that a CVR fetus experience airway compression before delivery.

Besides, I wrote an article that reviewed the relationship between fetal congenital heart disease and its brain development, the progress of prenatal MRI quantitative evaluation of the cardiovascular and brain structures, blood flow, oxygen saturation, brain maturity, and metabolism in the fetuses with congenital heart disease.

Calculation of fetal brain structure and function network using multimodal quantitative and functional magnetic resonance imaging (Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, 19ZR1476700)
------

My work:

A total of 30 fetuses of tetralogy of Fallot and 60 normal fetuses were studied retrospectively. I measured the diameter of the fetal brain biparietal diameter (BBD), brain frontal-occipital length (BFOL), skull biparietal diameter (SBD), skull fronto-occipital diameter (SOD), head circumference (HC), aortic arch isthmus (AoI), the main pulmonary artery (MPA) and the ratio was calculated (MPA/AoI). The size of ventricular septal defect (VSD) was measured in TOF group. 

This case-control study reached the following conclusions: MRI is feasible to measure the cardiovascular structure and the brain development of fetuses with TOF. Fetuses with TOF have varying degrees of VSD, MPA stenosis and AoI dilation. An altered brain growth of fetuses with TOF appears in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Personal Life
======
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, cycling and China classic dance. 

The furthest I rode was 100 kilometers in one night, and I ended up enjoying a beautiful sunrise. What's more, I have a strong interest in voluntary work. For example, I taught 100 primary school students the Heimlich Maneuver and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In addition, I once served as a volunteer for the second China International Import Expo and worked 124 hours in this event.
